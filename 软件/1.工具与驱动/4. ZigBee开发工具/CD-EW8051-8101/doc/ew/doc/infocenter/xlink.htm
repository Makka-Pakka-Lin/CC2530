<h3><a NAME="important"></a>Important information</h3>
<h4><a NAME="DebugModulesUsedInReleaseLink"></a>XLINK 5.0.2.5 - 2010-Nov-05</h4>

<ul>   
  <li><a NAME="ew22072"></a><b>EW22072</b> When not building an
  application for use with the C-SPY debugger (not using
  the <tt>-r</tt> command line option) XLINK could still include
  symbol definitions from the runtime library intended only for use
  with C-SPY, instead of generating an undefined external error, as
  expected, when the application did not otherwise include definitions
  for the needed symbols. The most common such symbol
  is <tt>__write</tt>.<p>

  This problem was introduced in <a href="#4.61L">XLINK 4.61L.</a><p>
</li>


  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a NAME="4wayVersionNumber"></a>XLINK 5.0.0.1 - 2010-May-17</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Starting with XLINK 5.0.0.1 the version number uses four numbers.
       Major version, minor version, revision and build number.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a NAME="NoDLLs"></a>XLINK 4.61A - 2007-Dec-10</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Starting with XLINK 4.61A the .dll version of xlink is no longer
       available.</li><p>
</ul>

<h4><a NAME="PackedAlignmentError"></a>XLINK 4.59P - 2005-09-28</h4>
<ul> 
    <li><b>EW17228</b>
    When doing packed segment placement (-P) and the input files
    contained sequences of segment parts with mixed alignment that
    were to be placed consecutively, XLINK treated those segment parts
    as if they had the highest alignment of any segment part in that
    sequence. This wasted space and lead to incorrect code when the
    code was fall through. <p>

    This problem was introduced in XLINK 4.58A. <p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h4><a NAME="RangesError"></a>XLINK 4.55H - 2003-05-13</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>EW14006</b>
       In segment placement commands, when using consecutive ranges 
       (like 0-FF,100-1FF,200-2FF or, equivalently, [0-2FF]/100), 
       XLINK treated the range as if it was 0-2FF without the 
       boundaries. Segments that were too large for the original 
       ranges would fit and segments could be placed across 
       boundaries that they should not be allowed to be placed 
       across.<p>

       This problem was introduced in XLINK 4.55B.<p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.55B - 2002-12-17</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAR Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format, UBROF,
    has been updated to version 10.0.0. This means that XLINK
    will now output UBROF 10 files when given UBROF 10 input. The
    UBROF format is used by IAR's C-SPY debugger and a number of
    other debuggers/emulators. The new version of the output
    format supports C++ templates, has no limit on the number of 
    segments and externals in a module and has no limit on the 
    number of types in a program.<p>

    XLIB supports UBROF 10 starting with version 3.28N.<p>

    All released versions of XAR support UBROF 10.<p>

    XLINK is now able to produce relocatable output, output
    that can be located after linking by a program loader.
    This is currently only supported for the ARM processor
    and the ELF output format.<p>
    
</li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.53J - 2002-03-18</h4>
<ul>
<li>
     <a href="xar.htm">XAR</a>, the IAR Universal Library Builder, is
     now included in the XLINK package. XAR has a very simple command
     line interface to construct library files from object files,
     which is likely to be far more convenient than using XLIB for the
     same purpose.<p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a NAME="SFEError"></a>XLINK 4.53I - 2002-02-19</h4>
<ul>
<li>
     XLINK calculated the wrong value for SFE (Segment End) directives
     for segments placed using far placement when the entire segment
     did not fit in a single 64K page. The incorrect value was too low
     by the amount of space skipped at the page boundaries.<p>

     Initialization of variables in far memory normally uses the SFE
     (or equivalently, SIZEOF) directive to determine the amount of
     data to set. This means that the incorrect value can result in
     some bytes of initialized or zeroed variables in far memory not
     being set at program start-up.<p>

     This problem was introduced in XLINK version 4.52E, released
     2001-02-19.<p>
</li>
</ul>


<h4>XLINK 4.53A - 2001-06-07</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAR Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format, UBROF,
    has been updated to version 9.1.0. This version supercedes UBROF
    9.0.0, for which version support has been dropped from XLINK.<p>

    XLIB supports UBROF 9.1 starting with version 3.28B.<p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.52A - 2000-10-20</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAR Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format, UBROF,
    has been updated to version 9.0.0. This means that XLINK
	will now output UBROF 9 files when given UBROF 9 input. The
	UBROF format is used by IAR's C-SPY debugger and a number of
	other debuggers/emulators. The new version of the output
	format improves debug information support. Specifically it
        adds support for call frame information and better statement
        information.<p>

    This adds a new output format to XLINK:<p>

    <ul><pre>-Fubrof9   Output UBROF 9 even if no input was UBROF 9</pre></ul><p>

    As before, using -r or -Fdebug will produce output using the
	latest version of UBROF used in any of the input files.<p>

    If you are using a debugger/emulator other than C-SPY that
	reads UBROF and a compiler generating UBROF 9 (check the
	documentation accompanying the compiler) and the output file
	cannot be loaded, the new format version could be the
	cause. In that case try using
        -Fubrof8/-Fubrof7/-Fubrof6/-Fubrof5 or
	contact the supplier of your debugger/emulator. Also be sure
	to check the compiler release notes for any pertinent
	information on this issue. As of this writing only one IAR
	compiler generates UBROF 9 output.<p>

    XLIB supports UBROF 9 starting with version 3.28A.<p>

</li>

<li>
    Starting with version 4.52A, the Windows release of XLINK is no
    longer delivered with a DOS extender. This means that XLINK will
    not work in environments that do not provide the Win32 interface
    (Win32 is provided in Windows 95 and later).

    <p>The same is true for XLIB, starting with version 3.28A.

<p></li>

</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.51D - 1998-12-01</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAR Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format, UBROF,
    has been updated to version 8.0.0. This means that XLINK
	will now output UBROF 8 files when given UBROF 8 input. The
	UBROF format is used by IAR's C-SPY debugger and a number of
	other debuggers/emulators. The new version of the output
	format adds support for Embedded C++.<p>

    This adds a new output format to XLINK:<p>

    <ul><pre>-Fubrof8   Output UBROF 8 even if no input was UBROF 8</pre></ul><p>

    As before, using -r or -Fdebug will produce output using the
	latest version of UBROF used in any of the input files.<p>

    If you are using a debugger/emulator other than C-SPY that
	reads UBROF and a compiler generating UBROF 8 (check the
	documentation accompanying the compiler) and the output file
	cannot be loaded, the new format version could be the
	cause. In that case try using -Fubrof7/-Fubrof6/-Fubrof5 or
	contact the supplier of your debugger/emulator. Also be sure
	to check the compiler release notes for any pertinent
	information on this issue. As of this writing only IAR
	compilers capable of compiling C++ generate UBROF 8 output.<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.51C - 1998-10-21</h4>
<ul>
<li>XLINK can now generate ELF format output with DWARF format
    debug information. See <a href="xman.htm#chap10">XMAN.HTM</a> for details.<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.51A - 1998-10-08</h4>
<ul>
<li>Segment placement has been improved. See <a href="xman.htm#chap08">
    XMAN.HTM</a> for details.<p></li>
</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.50C - 1998-05-14</h4>
<ul>
<li>The IAR Universal Binary Relocatable Object Format, UBROF,
    has been updated to version 7.0.0. This means that XLINK
	will now output UBROF 7 files when given UBROF 7 input. The
	UBROF format is used by IAR's C-SPY debugger and a number of
	other debuggers/emulators. The new version of the output
	format exists mainly to expand the system for keeping track
	of IAR specific type and object attributes.<p>

	This adds a new output format to XLINK:<p>

	<ul><pre>-Fubrof7   Output UBROF 7 even if no input was UBROF 7</pre></ul><p>
	
	As before, using -r or -Fdebug will produce output using the
	latest version of UBROF used in any of the input files.<p>
	
	If you are using a debugger/emulator that reads UBROF and a
	compiler generating UBROF 7 (check the documentation
	accompanying the compiler) and the output file cannot be
	loaded, the new format version could be the cause. In that
	case try using -Fubrof6/-Fubrof5 or contact the supplier of
	your debugger/emulator. Also be sure to check the compiler
	release notes for any pertinent information on this issue.<p></li>

<h4>XLINK 5.0.2.5 - 2010-Nov-05</h4>
<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew10551"></a><b>EW10551</b> [XLINK0151] SFRs are not
    present in the IEEE-695 output from XLINK for code compiled with
    compilers using UBROF 6 and earlier.</li><p>

<li><a NAME="ew10554"></a><b>EW10554</b> [XLINK0119] When doing
    static overlay, XLINK fails to warn about functions called from
    indirect functions and from someplace else.  This is dangerous,
    if, for instance, one of these is from an interrupt function and
    the other from main.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew10555"></a><b>EW10555</b> [XLINK0116] Under certain
    circumstances XLINK can fail to place empty segments.  This will
    happen if the entire memory address range in which to place the
    empty segments has already been taken by previous segment
    placements, or by absolute code from assembler modules, but the
    address (not the byte) after the range is still free.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew10556"></a><b>EW10556</b> [XLINK0107] Empty segments
    placed in previous segment placement commands do not cause later
    segment placements ranges to split. Example: -ZEMPTY=400-4FF
    -ZBAR=0-FFFF. This should place the empty segment EMPTY at address
    400 and cause the range 0-FFFF to be split into 0-3FF and
    400-FFFF.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew10557"></a><b>EW10557</b> [XLINK0045] Static overlay
    system: A function which does not appear to be called (warning 39)
    still counts as a caller for warning 16 (function called from two
    function trees), resulting in two warnings instead of one.
    <p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew10558"></a><b>EW10558</b> [XLINK0136] Specifying
    filler ranges explicitly (using -h) does not work if any segment
    parts are placed using banked placement (-b). Use packed
    placement (-P) instead.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="EW18364_rest"></a><b>EW18364</b> When generating output
    in the ELF/DWARF output format for the H8 processor, XLINK fails
    to generate correct debug information for variables placed in
    bit-memory. It is not possible to inspect or modify such variables
    through its name in a debugger.<p></li>

<li>XLINK can now generate output in the simple-code format. Simple code
    is a simple binary format that is primarily intended as a format
    for flash loading. Support for simple-code was introduced in XLINK
    4.59C but is made public in the documentation for 4.59E. See 
    <a href="xman.htm#chap01">xman.htm</a> for the details.<p></li>

<li>XLINK can now generate output in the raw-binary format. Raw binary
    is a binary image format. It contains nothing but pure binary
    data. See <a href="xman.htm#chap01">xman.htm</a> for the
    details.<p></li>

<li>XLINK can now read a raw binary image and link its contents.
<pre>
  --image_input=file,symbol,segment,alignment
</pre>
    The content of the file <i>file</i> is put into a segment part of
    the segment <i>segment</i>. The segment part defines the symbol
    <i>symbol</i> and has an alignment of <i>alignment</i>.<p>

    See <a href="xman.htm#chap_l:image_input">xman.htm</a> for further
    details.<p>

<li>A new experimental format variant, 1 (-Y1), has been added to the
    aomf8051 output format. It can be specified to make XLINK use the
    SEGID field to contain the bank number (0-0xFF) of addresses
    greater than 0xFFFF. If this experimental option is not used the
    SEGID field will always be 0. Note that this is a non standard
    extension of the aomf8051 format.<p></li>

<li> Beginning with version 4.58B, XLINK employs a more relaxed link
     model. Undefined external errors (error 46) are now generated
     only if the referenced symbol is actually needed by the

<h4>XLINK 4.56H - 2004-02-11</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew14692"></a><b>EW14692</b> When linking files that
    contain SFB and SFE (the start and end address of a segment)
    references to a packed segment but where those references were not
    needed (and thus not included) in the output, XLINK could
    terminate with a "segment didn't fit" internal error.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14754"></a><b>EW14754</b> When producing COFF output
    for input files that contain block-local struct or union types,
    XLINK erroneously classified these as C++ identifiers. This

    output format").<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14806"></a><b>EW14806</b> When using the output format
    COFF, XLINK did not check that the number of line number data
    entry records did not exceed the maximum (64K) in the section
    header for each section, resulting in drastic loss of debugging
    usability. XLINK now issues a warning in this case (<a
    href="xman.htm#warning59">warning 59</a>) and includes as many
    entries as can fit. For the MPLAB debugger for the PIC processor,
    one line number data entry record is needed for each
    instruction.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14819"></a><b>EW14819</b> When linking a file that
    contains two or more PUBWEAK entries for a single segment part,
    XLINK could silently fail to determine the address of the segment
    part and would use address 0 instead of the correct address. XLINK
    now checks explicitly for this error condition and emits <a
    href="xman.htm#error143">error 143</a>.<p>

    The ARM compiler could generate such erroneous code for inline
    functions in interwork mode. It is also possible to write assembly
    code for any processor that triggers the problem.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14848"></a><b>EW14848</b> When producing output in the
    ELF/DWARF format, XLINK did not correctly align the sections in
    the ELF/DWARF file on a 4-byte boundary, except when producing
    output for the ARM Ltd ARM debugger. Note: This only concerns the
    representation of the program in the ELF-file, not the program
    itself.<p></li>

<li>When producing output in the UBROF version 7 or older XLINK did
    not handle symbol and type names longer than 255 characters
    correctly. Such symbol and type names result primarily from the
    flattening of C++ names that is performed when translating C++
    modules using UBROF 8 or later to an earlier version of UBROF. Any
    such names would result in a corrupt output file from XLINK. When
    needed, the name is now truncated and <a

    generated files will contain the special C-SPY modules, they will
    not work well when run in an environment not involving
    C-SPY. Under special circumstances the combination of -r and -O is
    exactly what you need but they should not be routinely used to
    generate additional output files in the belief that the additional
    output files can be used just like a file in the same format that
    is generated using -F. <p> Example:<br> <tt>xlink -rt
    -Omotorola=.mot -o output.dXX ...<br></tt><p> This will generate

    to that the entire segment was listed as residing at an incorrect
    address and having an incorrect size (if the segment had more than
    1 segment part).<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14488"></a><b>EW14488</b> When linking a project that
    ignores cstartup, without supplying a replacement (this lead to an
    empty prgram), XLINK did not report any byte useage. This caused a
    "Build aborted" error when XLINK was run from the Embedded
    Workbench.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14505"></a><b>EW14505</b> When doing list-object-code,

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew14053"></a><b>EW14053</b> When run without arguments
    from the command line, XLINK now outputs all options and exits
    without waiting for input. <p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14207"></a><b>EW14207</b> When generating ELF/DWARF
    output for the ARM processor, XLINK mistakenly considered files
    that contained VFP-doubles to be corrupt.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14341"></a><b>EW14341</b> When producing COFF output
    for files that contained static functions or variables, XLINK

<li><a NAME="ew14435"></a><b>EW14435</b> While producing error
    messages for range errors, XLINK could termiante with an internal
    error if the code responsible for the range error was located in
    the last file block of the input file. This problem has been
    present in XLINK since the introduction of the new range errors
    messages.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew14446"></a><b>EW14446</b> When generating filler bytes
    for common segments, XLINK did not generate any filler byte for
    the bytes in the common segment that had no defined value.<p></li>

<li> When doing function auto storage layout for processors that use
     the static overlay system, XLINK now only emits warning 16
     (function is called from two function trees) when the called
     function actually needs any static overlay storage space.<p></li>

<li> A new segment placement command modifier, SPLIT-, has been
     introduced. The SPLIT- modifier is only available for -Z
     (sequential segment placement) and allows XLINK to place the
     individual segment parts of the segment non-contiguously.<p>

     See <a href="xman.htm#chap07">xman.htm</a> for more information
     on the new feature.<p>

<li> The -U command line option (address space sharing, introduced in

     -U.<p>

<li> The memory requirement of XLINK have been significantly reduced
     in many cases.<p></li>

<li> When producing two or more output files where at least one is a
     simple output format without debug information (for instance
     Intel Hex or Motorola S-records ) XLINK now requires
     significantly less time.  <p></li>

<h4>XLINK 4.55I - 2003-06-06</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew14022"></a><b>EW14022</b> When outputting UBROF version
    10 files involving C++ code, XLINK generated incorrect skip

<li> When using packed segment placement (-P), the order of the
     segment names in the list of segments that were combined was not
     correctly sorted in alphabetical order. This does not affect the
     addresses of segments in any way, it is a pure cosmetic change in
     the map-file.<p></li>

<li> When producing xcoff78k, XLINK no longer adds a _ to assembler symbol

    4.55B.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13680"></a><b>EW13680</b> When a segment did not fit in
    the available ranges and at least one bit segment had been placed,
    the ranges that XLINK presented as relevant to the occupied memory
    could be both superflous and erroneous.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13681"></a><b>EW13681</b> When placing bit segments,
    XLINK reserved 1 byte too much space. If the segment consisted of
    15 bits it would occupy 3 bytes instead of the expected 2. This
    problem was introduced in XLINK 4.55B.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13698"></a><b>EW13698</b> When the entry point of the
    program was located in a function that was suppressed (not
    included in the output) XLINK would crash. Note: It does not make
    sense to have the program's entry point in a suppressed
    function.<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13705"></a><b>EW13705</b> XLIB did not always handle
    UBROF 10 files correctly. Some operations produced corrupt output
    when the number of types (including the built in ones) was below
    128 or above 32767. The list commands (with the exception of
    list-object-code) and all commands that produced a new file did
    not handle UBROF macros.<p></li>

<li>A new list file option, -xn, generate module summary, is now

<h4>XLINK 4.55D - 2003-02-13</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew12541"></a><b>EW12541</b> When generating listfiles
    XLINK no longer always claims that the first label in a segment
    part makes all references in that segment part. If a segment part
    contains several labels XLINK now lists its number instead of
    claiming, possibly erroneously, that a certain label is the
    referer. This mainly affects older tools (UBROF 6 and older) but
    might affect newer tools too if they contain segment parts with
    many labels (e.g. assembler modules).<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13250"></a><b>EW13250</b> When doing banked segment

<li><a NAME="ew13412"></a><b>EW13412</b> XLINK crashed when -H (fill
    unused code memory) was used without a hexstring. This now results
    in error 39 (illegal character specified in option).<p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew13449"></a><b>EW13449</b> When using the static overlay

<h4>XLINK 4.55C - 2003-01-20</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew13286"></a><b>EW13286</b> XLINK has been updated to

<li> A new way of specifying ranges ([start:+size]) is now
     available.<p></li>



</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.53P - 2002-11-15</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew12961"></a><b>EW12961</b> XLINK did not create intra
    segment fillers as it should when the range specific version of

<li><a NAME="ew12643"></a><b>EW12643</b> When generating ELF/DWARF
    output XLINK used an incorrect offset for statement information
    using the const_add_pc tag. This lead to discrepancies between the
    generated file and the compiler list file and could result in the
    debugger setting a breakpoint at the wrong location.<p></li>

<li> When producing ELF/DWARF output XLINK now uses the end point of
     the source line information to set the column and row
     number. Older versions of XLINK used the start point of the
     source line information to set the column and row number. Setting
     the numbers to the end of the source line information instead of
     the start should lead to improved compatibility with some third
     party debuggers while remaining compatible with others.<p></li>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew12099"></a><b>EW12099</b> The experimental -P$

<h4>XLINK 4.53J - 2002-03-18</h4>

<ul>

<li><a NAME="ew11621"></a><b>EW11621</b> Type checking for K&R
    functions has been weakened to eliminate unwanted type conflict
    diagnostics for code compiled with newer compilers that provide
    less detailed information about calls to such functions.  <p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew11616"></a><b>EW11616</b> The information about whether
    a function type involved in a type conflict diagnostic was K&R or

    prototyped, and prototyped function types were marked as K&R.
    <p></li>

<li><a NAME="ew11615"></a><b>EW11615</b> ARM-ELF specifies a flag,

    ARM processor.  <p></li>

</ul>

<h4>XLINK 4.53A - 2001-06-07</h4>
    
<ul>

<li>XLINK now supports an arbitrary number of output files in
    different output formats. An added feature over the experimental
    support that has been present since XLINK 4.51G is the possibility
    to restrict the output in one file to only one address space. See
    <A HREF="xman.htm#chap17">xman.htm</a> for more information.
    <p></li>

<li>Added support for the cr16c processor.
<p></li>

<li>For the u8 processor, the CONST segment type is now considered to
    be in the same address space as the CODE segment type.  <p></li>

<li>Using the -ym format variant modifier (Output types in each
    compilation unit, instead of once for all) for the output format
    ELF resulted in XLINK producing an illegal output file.  <p></li>

<li>Improved the prospects for continuing meaningfully (via -B) after
    a Segment Already Defined error (error 101).  <p></li>

<li><a NAME="xlink0191"></a><b>XLINK0191:</b> XLINK sometimes ignored
    the alignment specification for empty segment parts. This could
    cause incorrect code to be generated.  This problem was introduced
    in XLINK 4.49A.  <p></li>

<li><a NAME="xlink0190"></a><b>XLINK0190:</b> XLINK crashed if a range
    error was detected in absolute code (assembler ASEG). This problem
    was introduced in XLINK 4.52A.  <p></li>

<li>When using the output format XCOFF78K, the line number information
    for block/function end was off by one.  <p></li>

<li>Some IAR compilers could emit debug information indicating a
    statement after the end of the code for a function. These are now
    no longer passed on by XLINK. This is known to have caused
    problems when using the output format XCOFF78K.  <p></li>

<li>Adjusted the output when using the ELF output format to work
    better with the CCS debugger from Texas Instruments for the ARM
    processor.  <p></li>

<li>XLINK 4.53A is the first version of XLINK that works with the
    Embedded Workbench version 3.  <p></li>

<li>XLINK now outputs more information for error e16 (segment is too
long for segment definition). All segments and absolute code that
overlap the requested address ranges will be reported. This
information will only appear in the linker list file if a list file is
being generated. Otherwise it will appear together with the error
message on standard output.
<p></li>

<li>New experimental feature: Address space sharing.<p>

    <ul><pre>-U[(<i>segment type</i>)]<i>ranges</i>=[(<i>segment type</i>)]<i>ranges</i></pre></ul><p>

    Each -U command line option declares that the memory given by the
    ranges on the left side of the '=' sign is the same memory as that
    given by the ranges on the right side. This has the effect that,
    during segment placement, anything occupying some part of either
    memory will be considered to reserve the corresponding part of the
    other memory as well.<p>

    The optional <tt>(<i>segment type</i>)</tt> that can be included
    on each side of the '=' sign can be used to specify the address
    space for architectures with multiple address spaces.<p>
    
    Example (assuming an architecture with separate code and address
    spaces and that the CODE segment type corresponds to the code
    address space and the DATA segment type to the data address
    space):<p>

    <ul><pre>
-U(CODE)4000-5FFF=(DATA)11000-12FFF
-P(CODE)MYCODE=4000-5FFF
-P(DATA)MYCONST=11000-12FFF</pre></ul><p>

    The first line declares that the memory at 4000-5FFF in the
    code address space are also mapped at 11000-12FFF in the data
    address space.<p>

    The second line places the MYCODE segment into the memory at
    4000-5FFF in the code address space. The corresponding bytes in
    the data address space will also be reserved. If MYCODE occupies
    the addresses 4000-473F, the range 11000-1173F in the data address
    space will also be reserved.<p>

    The third line will place the MYCONST segment into what ever parts
    of the 11000-12FFF memory range are not reserved. In this case it
    will behave as if it were written:
    "<tt>-P(DATA)MYCONST=11740-12FFF</tt>".
